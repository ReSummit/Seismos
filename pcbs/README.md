# Required PCBs to upload

Thank you for downloading the PCB files! For PCBs, you will need the following:
* Minimum 2 core PCBs for left and right hands
* At least 14 mantle PCBs, 7 per core PCB
    * For cost, you may want to just stick with 20 of one type of mantle. 5 or 4 rows are usually enough

### **NOTE:** For the Core PCBs, you wil need to choose if you want I2C only or with a shift register. If you want to minimize components needed **and you are sure that you have an ATMEGA microcontroller**, you should choose I2C only. If you are not sure, you should choose I2C with shift register and just get the 74HC595A.
